B) Converts block cipher to stream cipher, uses IV

C) No chaining

D) Parallel processing

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **CFB (Cipher Feedback)** mode converts a **block cipher into a stream cipher**
- Uses **IV (Initialization Vector)** for the first block
- Each ciphertext block is fed back as input for encrypting the next block
- Can encrypt data smaller than block size (e.g., individual bytes)
- **Self-synchronizing:** errors propagate but eventually stop
- Useful for encrypting streaming data
- Cannot be parallelized (sequential process)

***

**Question 61** (🟡 Medium)

**OFB (Output Feedback)** mode:

A) Same as CFB

B) Creates keystream from IV, XORed with plaintext; error in one block doesn't propagate

**Explanation:**
✅ **OFB (Output Feedback)** mode generates a **keystream** from the IV
- Encrypts the IV repeatedly to create a keystream
- **XORs keystream with plaintext** to produce ciphertext
- **Errors don't propagate:** a bit error in ciphertext only affects that same bit in plaintext
- Good for noisy channels (radio, satellite) where transmission errors occur
- Cannot be parallelized (sequential keystream generation)
- Similar to CFB but feedback is from cipher output, not ciphertext

## 🎯 KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 4

### **⚡ CRITICAL CONCEPTS:**

1. **Encoding vs Encryption** [MOST IMPORTANT!]
    - Encoding: NO KEY, reversible, well-known algorithm
    - Encryption: NEEDS KEY for security
2. **Symmetric vs Asymmetric**
    - Symmetric: 1 key, fast, bulk encryption, key distribution problem
    - Asymmetric: 2 keys, slow, short messages, solves key distribution
3. **Hashing Properties**
    - Fixed length output
    - One-way (can't reverse)
    - Collision-resistant
    - Used for digital signatures
4. **Digital Signature = Integrity + Authentication + Non-repudiation**
5. **PKI Components**
    - CA: Signs certificates
    - RA: Verifies users
    - Certificate: Public key + info + CA signature

### **📝 KEY ALGORITHMS TO KNOW:**

**Symmetric:**

- RC4 (stream, weak)
- DES (56-bit, weak)
- 3DES (DES 3x)
- AES (128/192/256-bit, current standard)

**Asymmetric:**

- RSA (1024-4096 bit)
- ECC (smaller keys, less power)

**Hashing:**

- MD5 (128-bit)
- SHA-1 (160-bit)
- SHA-256 (256-bit)
- SHA-512 (512-bit)


### **⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES:**

1. ❌ Confusing encoding and encryption
2. ❌ Thinking asymmetric is faster
3. ❌ Forgetting ECB vulnerability (identical plaintext → identical ciphertext)
4. ❌ Not knowing permutation formula is NOT required
5. ❌ Thinking encryption provides availability (it provides C \& I only!)
