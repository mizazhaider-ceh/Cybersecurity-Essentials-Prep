**Instructions:** Write answer without spaces, capitalize first letter.

**Answer:** Confidentiality

**Explanation:** Confidentiality ensures information is protected from unauthorized access/disclosure. Related to privacy laws like GDPR/AVG.

**Common Mistakes:**

- Writing "Privacy" (related but not the exact term)
- Lowercase "confidentiality" (capitalize!)

***

**Question 4** (🟡 Medium)

Which of the following is a method to ensure **Confidentiality**?

A) Backups and replication

B) Digital signatures

C) Encryption

D) Redundancy systems

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
✅ **Encryption** protects confidentiality by making data unreadable to unauthorized parties.
❌ A) Backups ensure **Availability**
❌ B) Digital signatures ensure **Integrity** and Non-repudiation
❌ D) Redundancy ensures **Availability**

**Key Distinction:** Match controls to the correct CIA principle they protect.

***

A) Confidentiality

B) Integrity

C) Availability

D) Non-repudiation

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Integrity** protects information from unauthorized modification. Changing data (bank account number) violates integrity.
❌ A) Confidentiality = unauthorized *access* or *disclosure*
❌ C) Availability = access to systems/data
❌ D) Non-repudiation = proving who sent/received information

**Exam Reality:** Know which CIA principle is violated in specific scenarios.

B) Hacker

C) Distribution of pictures

D) Photos (or honor of person)
E) Computer not sufficiently protected

**Answer:** 1-D, 2-E, 3-B, 4-C, 5-A

**Explanation:**

1. **Asset** = Photos/honor (what has value)
2. **Vulnerability** = Insufficient computer protection
3. **Threat Agent** = Hacker
4. **Threat** = Distribution of pictures (NOT the theft - that already happened)
5. **Control** = Better security measures

**Common Mistake:** Confusing the theft (past event) with the threat (potential distribution).

***

**Question 18** (🟡 Medium)

The combination of probability of an event and its consequence is:

A) Vulnerability

Risk is mitigated through controls.

***

**Question 19** (🟡 Medium)

**Fill in the blank:**

The risk level without considering any controls is called _________ risk.

**Answer:** Inherent

**Explanation:**

- **Inherent risk** = risk before controls
- **Residual risk** = remaining risk after controls are implemented

A) Threat agent

B) Stakeholder

C) Control owner

D) Risk manager

What exists?

A) Vulnerability only

B) Vulnerability and Threat

C) Vulnerability and Risk

D) Threat and Risk only

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
✅ **Vulnerability** exists (the software flaw)
✅ **Risk** exists (potential for exploitation)
❌ **Threat** is debatable - researcher is not a threat agent (yet), but other unknown actors could exploit it

**Edge Case:** This tests understanding that risk exists even without known active threats.

***

**True or False:**

"If all known vulnerabilities are patched, the residual risk becomes zero."

**Answer:** False

**Explanation:**
**False!** 100% security is impossible.

- Unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) exist
- New vulnerabilities are discovered
- Human error always introduces risk
- **Residual risk** always remains after controls

**THE TRAP:** Students think perfect security is achievable. It's not!

***

**Question 93** (🔴 Hard)

Which statement is MOST accurate about the relationship between threats and vulnerabilities?

A) Threats create vulnerabilities

B) Vulnerabilities create threats

C) Threats exploit vulnerabilities to target assets

D) Threats and vulnerabilities are the same thing

❌ D) Completely different concepts

***

**Question 94** (🔴 Hard - SCENARIO)

**Scenario:** A company implements a new firewall (control) but misconfigures it, leaving port 23 (Telnet) open to the internet.

What happened?

A) The control reduced risk as expected

B) The control introduced a new vulnerability

C) The threat agent was eliminated

D) The asset was protected

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Controls can have vulnerabilities!** The misconfigured firewall is now itself a vulnerability.
Example from slides: Anti-malware faulty update caused blue screens.

**Key Lesson:** Controls are not perfect and can introduce new risks.

***

**Question 95** (🔴 Hard)

Inherent risk is _________ than residual risk.

A) Always lower

B) Always higher

C) The same as

D) Unrelated to

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Inherent risk** (before controls) is **always higher** than **residual risk** (after controls)
Controls are implemented specifically to reduce risk from inherent to residual level.
