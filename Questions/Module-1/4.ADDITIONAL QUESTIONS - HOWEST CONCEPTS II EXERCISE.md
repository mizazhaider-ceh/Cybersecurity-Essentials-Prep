## **PART K: DEFENSE IN DEPTH CLASSIFICATION (20 NEW QUESTIONS)**

### **Instructions:**

Classify each scenario as:

- **Concentric Rings** (nested layers)
- **Overlapping Redundancy** (multiple controls in parallel at same place)
- **Segregation** (separation of duties, multiple people needed, or network isolation)

***

**Question 173** (🟡 Medium)

A bank requires two employees to be present to open the vault, and each has only half of the combination code.

**Answer:** Segregation

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two people needed** who can't act alone = **Segregation**.
Similar to bunker with two colonels needing eye scanner.

***

**Question 174** (🟡 Medium)

A server room has a biometric lock on the door, security cameras inside, and motion detectors. The servers themselves have encrypted hard drives.

**Answer:** Concentric Rings

**Explanation:**
✅ **Multiple nested layers** (door → cameras → motion detectors → encryption) = **Concentric Rings**.
Each layer must be bypassed to reach data.

***

**Question 175** (🟡 Medium)

A laptop has both fingerprint scanner AND password protection to log in.

**Answer:** Overlapping Redundancy

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two controls in parallel** at same authentication point = **Overlapping Redundancy**.
Similar to lock AND alarm on door.

***

**Question 176** (🟡 Medium)

A company separates its guest Wi-Fi network from corporate network using VLANs.

**Answer:** Segregation

**Explanation:**
✅ **Network isolation** to prevent lateral movement = **Segregation**.
Breach in guest network doesn't affect corporate.

***

**Question 177** (🔴 Hard)

A data center has: perimeter fence with guards → building access badge → elevator requiring badge → server room biometric lock → server rack lock → encrypted hard drives.

**Answer:** Concentric Rings

**Explanation:**
✅ **Multiple nested layers** that must be penetrated one by one = **Concentric Rings**.
Classic defense in depth with 6 layers.

***

**Question 178** (🟡 Medium)

A company has both Fortinet firewall AND Cisco firewall installed at the Internet perimeter.

**Answer:** Overlapping Redundancy

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two firewalls in parallel** at same location (Internet perimeter) = **Overlapping Redundancy**.
Hope one catches what the other misses. (Professor notes: "almost never done in practice")

***

**Question 179** (🟡 Medium)

Financial transactions require approval from both the Finance Manager and the CEO before processing.

**Answer:** Segregation

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two people needed** for authorization, division of duties = **Segregation**.

***

**Question 180** (🔴 Hard)

A medieval castle has: moat → outer wall with archers → inner courtyard with soldiers → keep (main tower) → treasure room.

**Answer:** Concentric Rings

**Explanation:**
✅ **Nested defensive layers** = **Concentric Rings**.
Similar to country house example with Dobermans outside, Rottweilers inside, armed owner.

***

**Question 181** (🟡 Medium)

Important files are both encrypted AND protected by Windows access control.

**Answer:** Overlapping Redundancy

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two controls operating simultaneously on same asset** = **Overlapping Redundancy**.
Both encryption and access control protect the same files.

***

**Question 182** (🟡 Medium)

A nuclear missile launch requires three officers to simultaneously turn keys that are positioned far apart.

**Answer:** Segregation

**Explanation:**
✅ **Multiple people needed** who cannot accomplish task alone = **Segregation**.

***

**Question 183** (🔴 Hard)

An IT security manager establishes access control rules, security operators manage the rules, and the CISO checks compliance in logs.

**Answer:** Segregation

**Explanation:**
✅ **Division of labor** - no single person has complete control = **Segregation**.
Even IT manager is checked by CISO.

***

**Question 184** (🟡 Medium)

A home has: alarm system on windows/doors AND a guard dog inside.

**Answer:** Overlapping Redundancy

**Explanation:**
✅ **Two different controls** protecting same perimeter/space in parallel = **Overlapping Redundancy**.

***

**Question 185** (🔴 Hard - TRICKY)

A company has: firewall between Internet and DMZ → web server in DMZ → firewall between DMZ and internal network → database server in internal network.

**Answer:** Concentric Rings (though could argue Segregation for DMZ)

**Explanation:**
✅ **Nested layers** (Internet → DMZ → Internal) = **Concentric Rings**
**Could also argue Segregation** because DMZ is isolated from internal network.
**Key distinction:** Focus on the **nested progression** inward = Concentric.

## **PART L: LOG ANALYSIS QUESTIONS (10 NEW)**

### **Scenario:** You are analyzing security logs

**Question 193** (🟡 Medium)

You see the following log pattern:

```
08:30:15 - Login failed - User: admin - IP: 192.168.1.50
08:30:17 - Login failed - User: admin - IP: 192.168.1.50
08:30:19 - Login failed - User: admin - IP: 192.168.1.50
08:30:21 - Login failed - User: admin - IP: 192.168.1.50
08:30:23 - Login successful - User: admin - IP: 192.168.1.50
```

What attack technique is being used?

**Answer:** Brute Force Attack

**Explanation:**
✅ **Multiple failed attempts followed by successful login** = **Brute Force Attack**.
Pattern from Howest Exercise 14: "Several failed attempts and then a succeeded attempt."

***

**Question 194** (🟡 Medium)

Why are **timestamps** essential in log files?

A) To save disk space

B) To correlate information from different sources and find links between events

C) For aesthetic purposes

D) Only for compliance

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Timestamps are essential** to **correlate information from different sources** and find links between logged events.

***

**Question 195** (🔴 Hard)

You notice an unusual pattern:

```
Normal activity on web server (1000 requests/hour average)
14:00 - 15:00: 50,000 requests from 1000 different IPs
Website becomes unavailable
```

What type of attack is this?

A) SQL injection

B) DDoS

C) Phishing

D) Social engineering

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Massive requests from multiple sources** overwhelming service = **DDoS attack**.

***

**Question 196** (🟡 Medium)

A SIEM correlates the following events:

- Firewall: Incoming connection attempt from 10.0.0.50
- Web server: SQL injection attempt from 10.0.0.50
- Database: Unauthorized query from web server account

This indicates:

A) Normal activity

B) Coordinated attack progressing through multiple layers

C) Random unrelated events

D) System maintenance

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ SIEM recognizes **pattern of related events from same IP** = **coordinated attack**.
Example from slides: "Attacks on web gateway and firewall simultaneously from similar IPs = organized invasion attempt."
