## **PART H: REAL-WORLD SCENARIO ANALYSIS (Howest Style)**

### **Scenario 1: The Hospital Ransomware**

**Article:**

*DÜSSELDORF, Germany — A woman who needed urgent medical treatment died after a ransomware attack on a hospital in Düsseldorf, Germany. The hospital had to turn away emergency patients, including the woman who later died at a more distant facility. Hackers encrypted 30 servers using the DoppelPaymer ransomware, disrupting critical hospital systems. The attack was not targeted at the hospital but at the Heinrich Heine University, with which it shares IT infrastructure. When authorities contacted the hackers and explained the situation, they provided the decryption key and ended the attack. Police are now investigating whether the woman's death constitutes negligent manslaughter.*

### **Scenario 2: The Boeing 737 MAX**

**Article:**

*Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes (Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302) killed 346 people. Investigations revealed that a flight control system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) received faulty data from a single angle-of-attack sensor. The system then automatically pushed the plane's nose down repeatedly, and pilots were unaware of this behavior or how to override it. Boeing had not adequately informed airlines or pilots about MCAS. The system lacked redundancy - it relied on data from only ONE sensor instead of cross-checking multiple sensors. Software updates and additional pilot training were mandated before the planes could fly again.*

### **Scenario 4: The Colonial Pipeline Shutdown**

**Article:**

*In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline - which supplies 45% of fuel consumed on the US East Coast - was hit by ransomware attack by the DarkSide cybercriminal group. The company proactively shut down its 5,500-mile pipeline for six days to contain the breach. The shutdown caused panic buying, fuel shortages, and gas station closures across southeastern states. Airlines had to reroute flights. Colonial Pipeline paid \$4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin to regain access to their systems (US authorities later recovered \$2.3 million). The attack exploited a VPN account that was not protected by multi-factor authentication. The hackers only targeted the billing/business systems, not the operational technology (OT) controlling the actual pipeline, but Colonial shut everything down out of caution.*

**Article:**

*During the 2013 holiday shopping season, retail giant Target suffered a massive data breach affecting 40 million credit/debit card numbers and 70 million customer records (names, addresses, phone numbers, emails). Hackers gained access through credentials stolen from Fazio Mechanical Services, a small HVAC contractor that had remote access to Target's network for billing and project management. The attackers used these credentials to infiltrate Target's network, then moved laterally to install malware on point-of-sale (POS) terminals that captured card data as customers swiped. Target's security team actually received automated alerts about the intrusion but did not act on them. The breach cost Target over \$200 million in settlements, and the CEO and CIO both resigned.*

### **Scenario 7: The NotPetya Wiper Attack**

**Article:**

*In June 2017, a devastating cyberattack spread globally, initially disguised as ransomware but actually a destructive wiper malware called NotPetya. It caused over \$10 billion in damages worldwide. The attack started by compromising M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian tax accounting software, and pushed malicious updates to users. NotPetya spread rapidly through networks using EternalBlue exploit (also used by WannaCry). Unlike ransomware, NotPetya was designed to destroy data permanently - there was no decryption key. Major companies affected included Maersk (shipping), Merck (pharmaceuticals), FedEx, Mondelez, and Rosneft. Maersk had to reinstall 4,000 servers and 45,000 computers. The US and UK governments attributed NotPetya to Russian military hackers, calling it the most destructive cyberattack in history.*

### **Scenario 8: The Uber Data Breach Cover-Up**

**Article:**

*In 2016, hackers stole personal data of 57 million Uber users and 600,000 driver's license numbers. The breach occurred when attackers found Uber credentials on GitHub (a code-sharing site) that gave access to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) data storage account. Instead of disclosing the breach, Uber paid the hackers \$100,000 to delete the data and keep quiet. Uber's Chief Security Officer orchestrated this cover-up, violating data breach notification laws. The breach wasn't publicly revealed until November 2017. Uber's new CEO, who discovered the cover-up, fired the CSO and disclosed the breach. Uber paid \$148 million in settlements to US states. The former CSO was later convicted of criminal obstruction of justice - a landmark case making him the first executive criminally charged for covering up a data breach.*

***

### **Scenario 9: The Stuxnet Worm**

**Article:**

*Stuxnet is considered the first known cyber weapon designed to cause physical damage. Discovered in 2010, this sophisticated worm targeted Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. Stuxnet exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows and specifically targeted Siemens industrial control systems (SCADA/PLC). The worm spread via USB drives and Windows network shares. Once inside Natanz, it identified specific Siemens controllers running centrifuges and altered their rotation speeds (speeding them up and slowing them down) while reporting normal operation to monitoring systems. This caused centrifuges to self-destruct while operators saw nothing wrong. About 1,000 centrifuges were destroyed, setting back Iran's nuclear program by years. Security researchers attribute Stuxnet to a joint US-Israeli operation codenamed "Olympic Games." The worm's code was so sophisticated that it required months of intelligence gathering and significant resources, suggesting nation-state development.*

### **Scenario 10: The Mirai Botnet DDoS**

**Article:**

*In October 2016, a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack disrupted major websites including Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, Spotify, and The New York Times across the US and Europe. The attack targeted Dyn, a company providing Domain Name System (DNS) services. The attack came from a botnet called Mirai, which infected over 600,000 Internet of Things (IoT) devices - primarily home routers, IP cameras, and DVRs. Most devices had default or hardcoded passwords like "admin/admin" or "root/12345". Mirai scanned the internet for vulnerable IoT devices, logged in using common default passwords, and enslaved them into a botnet army. The infected devices then flooded Dyn with 1.2 Terabits per second of traffic, overwhelming their servers. Three college students created Mirai, initially to gain competitive advantage in Minecraft gaming servers. The source code was later released publicly, leading to copycat attacks.*

## **PART I: MULTIPLE CHOICE - SCENARIO INFERENCE (25 Questions)**


***

**Question 111** (🟡 Medium - INFERENCE)

In the Antwerp bank robbery scenario, the professor's answer notes "A, although something could be said for C depending on safe contents".

Why is **Availability** the PRIMARY CIA principle violated, not Confidentiality?

A) Because nobody knew what was in the safes

B) Because the goal was to REMOVE the contents (unavailability of asset)

C) Because confidentiality only applies to digital data

D) Because the safe contents weren't disclosed publicly

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ The main goal was **removing/stealing** the contents of the safes (making them **unavailable** to rightful owners).
While contents may be sensitive (Confidentiality concern), the PRIMARY violation is **removal/unavailability** of the asset.
❌ C) Confidentiality applies to physical assets too
❌ D) Disclosure isn't required for Confidentiality breach

**Key Learning:** Theft = Availability violation (asset removed). If contents were VIEWED but not taken, that would be Confidentiality.

***

**Question 112** (🟡 Medium - INFERENCE)

In the Derk Bolt kidnapping scenario, the CIA principle is marked as "A (removal of the asset)".

What would the CIA principle be if the kidnappers demanded ransom but HADN'T kidnapped anyone yet (just sent threatening letters)?

A) Still Availability

B) Non-repudiation

C) No CIA violation yet - only a Threat exists

D) Confidentiality

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
✅ **No CIA violation yet** - threatening letters create a **Threat** and **Risk**, but no asset has been compromised.
CIA principles are violated when actual harm occurs (unauthorized access, modification, or unavailability).
Threats are *potential* - CIA violations are *actual*.

**Key Concept:** Distinguish between **Threat** (potential) and **CIA violation** (actual harm).

***

**Question 113** (🔴 Hard - INFERENCE)

The Facebook breach  is marked as "C" (Confidentiality). But the article mentions attackers "exploited features" and "potentially take control" of accounts.

Could this ALSO violate Integrity? Why or why not?

A) No - only Confidentiality was violated

B) Yes - if attackers modified account information

C) Yes - because "take control" implies potential to modify data

D) No - "potentially" means it didn't happen

**Answer:** C (though B is also acceptable depending on what actually occurred)

**Explanation:**
✅ **"Take control of accounts"** suggests potential to:

- Modify account settings (Integrity)
- Post as the user (Integrity)
- Change passwords (Integrity)

The PRIMARY violation was **Confidentiality** (unauthorized ACCESS to 50M accounts), but control over accounts opens **Integrity** concerns.

**Professor's Note from file:** "Some of your answers may also be correct depending on the context"

***

**Question 114** (🟡 Medium)

NYC blackout: "CIA: A"

A power blackout primarily affects which information state from the McCumber Cube?

A) Storage

B) Transmission

C) Processing

D) All three

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
✅ **All three information states** are affected:

- **Storage** - Can't access stored data without power
- **Transmission** - Can't transmit data without powered network equipment
- **Processing** - Can't process information without powered computers

**Key Insight:** Availability often affects ALL information states simultaneously.

***

**Question 115** (🔴 Hard - TRAP)

Police/WannaCry ransomware: "CIA: A (later with WannaCry also C)"

Why does WannaCry add Confidentiality concern while Reveton (fake police) doesn't?

A) WannaCry was more sophisticated

B) WannaCry encrypted data (Availability) but also potentially exfiltrated data (Confidentiality)

C) Reveton only locked the screen; WannaCry locked files

D) WannaCry spread globally while Reveton was limited

**Answer:** B (though C is partially correct)

**Explanation:**
✅ **B)** WannaCry variants exfiltrated (stole) data before encryption, adding **Confidentiality** breach
✅ **C)** True - Reveton was screen locker (Availability), WannaCry encrypted files (Availability + potential data theft = Confidentiality)
❌ A \& D) Sophistication and spread don't change CIA principles

**Key Distinction:**

- **Screen lock** = Availability only
- **Data encryption + theft** = Availability + Confidentiality

***

**Question 116** (🟡 Medium)

Website defacement (Iran-US tensions): "CIA: I"

Why is this Integrity, not Availability?

A) Because the website still works, just shows wrong content

B) Because users can't access the legitimate website

C) Because it's political, not technical

D) Because no data was stolen

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
✅ **Website defacement** = unauthorized **MODIFICATION** of content = **Integrity** violation
The website is still **available** (you can access it), but the content is **wrong/modified**.

If hackers took the website completely offline (DDoS), that would be **Availability**.

**Key Distinction:**

- **Defacement** (content changed) = Integrity
- **Website down** (can't access) = Availability

***

**Question 117** (🟡 Medium)

Stan Van Samang phishing: "CIA: C"

The vulnerability is listed as "Human nature". What type of vulnerability is this?

A) Technical vulnerability

B) Physical vulnerability

C) Human/Social Engineering vulnerability

D) Process vulnerability

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
✅ **Social engineering** exploits human psychology - trust, curiosity, fear, desire for connection.
"Human nature" = people's natural tendencies that can be manipulated.

**Types of Vulnerabilities:**

- **Technical**: Software bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords
- **Physical**: Weak locks, unguarded doors, exposed cables
- **Human**: Social engineering, lack of awareness, poor judgment
- **Process**: Poor procedures, missing policies, weak controls

***

**Question 118** (🔴 Hard)

Credit card skimming: "CIA: C"

The article mentions "Heat-sensitive cameras on mobile devices can help figure out your PIN."

If a skimmer steals BOTH card data (magnetic stripe) AND PIN (via camera), what additional CIA principle is violated beyond Confidentiality?

A) Integrity - because PIN is modified

B) Availability - because card becomes unavailable

C) None - it's still only Confidentiality

D) Non-repudiation - because attacker can impersonate you

**Answer:** C (primarily), though D has merit

**Explanation:**
✅ **C)** Both card data and PIN are **confidential information** being stolen = **Confidentiality** breach
**D)** **Non-repudiation** concern: Attacker can now perform transactions AS YOU (impersonation), and you might struggle to prove it wasn't you.

**Not Integrity** - data isn't modified, just copied
**Not Availability** - you can still use your card (until fraudulent charges occur)

***

**Question 119** (🟡 Medium - INFERENCE)

Train disaster: "CIA: A (availability of transport). A case could be made for I if you take the railroad itself as asset."

Explain the Integrity argument:

A) The tracks were physically damaged (integrity of infrastructure)

B) Train schedules were modified

C) Communication systems failed

D) Passenger data was corrupted

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
✅ **Physical integrity of the railroad** - landslip damaged/blocked tracks (unauthorized "modification" by natural forces)

**Key Insight:** CIA principles can apply to PHYSICAL assets:

- **Confidentiality**: Locked physical documents
- **Integrity**: Undamaged physical infrastructure
- **Availability**: Accessible physical systems

Professor notes context matters - both interpretations are valid.

***

**Question 120** (🔴 Hard - MULTIPLE CONCEPTS)

**Scenario:** A disgruntled employee who was just fired deletes critical customer database before leaving. Backups exist but are 2 weeks old.

Which CIA principle is violated, and what is the CONTROL that limits damage?

A) Confidentiality violated; Control = Encryption

B) Integrity violated; Control = Backups

C) Availability violated; Control = Backups

D) All three violated; Control = Access controls

**Answer:** C (though B is arguable)

**Explanation:**
✅ **Primary violation: Availability** - Database is deleted/unavailable
✅ **Control that limits damage: Backups** - Data can be restored (though 2 weeks old)

**Could argue Integrity:**

- Data "modification" (deletion) = Integrity
- But result is data UNAVAILABILITY

**Professor's guidance:** "Context matters"  - either answer defensible.

**Better Control:** Access revocation BEFORE firing employee!
