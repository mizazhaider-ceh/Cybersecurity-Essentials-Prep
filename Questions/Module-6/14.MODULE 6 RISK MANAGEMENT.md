## 🎯 **KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 6**

### **⚡ MUST KNOW FOR EXAM:**

From exam review:

1. ✅ **Risk Identification and Classification Standards** (COBIT, ISO, NIST)
2. ✅ **Frameworks**
3. ✅ **Risk Identification**
4. ✅ **Risk Scenario diagram (slide 12)** ← RECOGNIZE THIS!
5. ✅ **Risk Assessments diagram** ← RECOGNIZE THIS!
6. ✅ **Risk Response Workflow (COBIT 5)**
7. ✅ **Penetration testers (who are they)**
8. ✅ **Example: penetration tester in action**
9. ✅ **Penetration Frameworks**
10. ✅ **Penetration Test Discovery Techniques** ← KNOW THESE!

### **📝 CRITICAL FORMULAS \& CONCEPTS:**

**Risk Formula:**

- **Risk = Likelihood × Impact**
- **Likelihood = f(Threat, Vulnerability, Controls)**
- **Inherent Risk** = risk WITHOUT controls
- **Residual Risk** = risk AFTER controls

**Risk Responses:**

1. **Reduction/Mitigation** (implement controls)
2. **Avoidance** (don't do risky activity)
3. **Transfer** (insurance, outsource)
4. **Acceptance** (live with it)

**Risk Assessment Inputs:**

1. Asset identification
2. Threat assessment
3. Vulnerability assessment

**Vulnerability Types:**

- Technical
- Process-related
- Organizational
- Emerging

**Pentest Phases:**

1. Planning
2. Discovery (OSINT, scanning, banner grabbing, social engineering)
3. Attack (exploit, escalate, install tools)
4. Reporting (with mitigation recommendations!)

### **🔧 KEY DISTINCTIONS:**

**Vulnerability Scan vs Penetration Test:**


| Feature | Vuln Scan | Pentest |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Method | Automated | Manual |
| Goal | Find vulnerabilities | Exploit vulnerabilities |
| Frequency | Quarterly | Annually |
| Duration | Minutes | Days/weeks |

**Pentest Types:**

- **Black box** = no knowledge
- **White box** = full knowledge
- **Grey box** = partial knowledge
- **External** = outside perimeter
- **Internal** = inside perimeter
- **Covert** = teams not informed

**Risk Approaches:**

- **Ad hoc** = random, no strategy (BAD!)
- **Compliance-based** = checklist mentality
- **Risk-based** = identify specific risks (BEST!)
