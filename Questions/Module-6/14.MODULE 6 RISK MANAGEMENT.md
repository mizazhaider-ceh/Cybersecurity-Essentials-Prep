    - Scan files
    - Upload/download files
    - Take screenshots
    - Record keystrokes (keylogger)
    - Install more tools
- **Goal:** Gain (more) access to systems/network and increase access (privilege escalation)

**True or False:** "Even failed exploits can provide useful information."

**Answer:** True

***

**Question 156** (🔴 **CRITICAL - REPORTING!**)

**Penetration Test - Reporting phase:**

**Make journals (notes)** during discovery and attack phases!

**Report contains:**

- Assessment plan (scope from planning)
- Results of discovery phase
- Vulnerabilities identified
- Assigned **risk classifications** (usually through **CVSS** = Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **Mitigation proposal or plan** ← **WITHOUT THIS, REPORT IS WORTHLESS!**

**True or False:** "Mitigation recommendations are the most important part of the report."

**Answer:** True

***

**Question 157** (🔴 **CRITICAL - PENTEST vs VULN SCAN!**)

**Differences between Penetration Tests and Vulnerability Scans:**


| Aspect | Vulnerability Scan | Penetration Test |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Goal** | Identifying, ranking, reporting vulnerabilities | Identifying ways to EXPLOIT vulnerabilities to bypass security controls |
| **When** | At least quarterly or after significant changes | At least annually and after significant changes |
| **How** | Automated tools + manual verification | Mostly MANUAL + may use automated tools |
| **Reports** | Potential risks of known vulnerabilities (NVD/CVSS scores) | Description of each vulnerability + specific exploitation methods + specific risks |
| **Duration** | Short (seconds to minutes per host) | Days or weeks (increases as more assets discovered) |

**Match:** "Automated scan finding known CVEs" = ?

**Answer:** Vulnerability Scan

**Match:** "Security expert manually attempting to escalate privileges" = ?

**Answer:** Penetration Test

***

**Question 158** (🟡 Medium - **NVD/CVSS!**)

**NVD** = National Vulnerability Database (from NIST)

**CVSS** = Common Vulnerability Scoring System

**Used for:**

A) Nothing

B) Ranking vulnerabilities with standardized scores

C) Only documentation

D) Entertainment

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **CVSS provides standardized vulnerability severity scores**
Used in both vulnerability scans and pentests for risk classification

## 🎯 **KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 6**

### **⚡ MUST KNOW FOR EXAM:**

From exam review:

1. ✅ **Risk Identification and Classification Standards** (COBIT, ISO, NIST)
2. ✅ **Frameworks**
3. ✅ **Risk Identification**
4. ✅ **Risk Scenario diagram (slide 12)** ← RECOGNIZE THIS!
5. ✅ **Risk Assessments diagram** ← RECOGNIZE THIS!
6. ✅ **Risk Response Workflow (COBIT 5)**
7. ✅ **Penetration testers (who are they)**
8. ✅ **Example: penetration tester in action**
9. ✅ **Penetration Frameworks**
10. ✅ **Penetration Test Discovery Techniques** ← KNOW THESE!

### **📝 CRITICAL FORMULAS \& CONCEPTS:**

**Risk Formula:**

- **Risk = Likelihood × Impact**
- **Likelihood = f(Threat, Vulnerability, Controls)**
- **Inherent Risk** = risk WITHOUT controls
- **Residual Risk** = risk AFTER controls

**Risk Responses:**

1. **Reduction/Mitigation** (implement controls)
2. **Avoidance** (don't do risky activity)
3. **Transfer** (insurance, outsource)
4. **Acceptance** (live with it)

**Risk Assessment Inputs:**

1. Asset identification
2. Threat assessment
3. Vulnerability assessment

**Vulnerability Types:**

- Technical
- Process-related
- Organizational
- Emerging

**Pentest Phases:**

1. Planning
2. Discovery (OSINT, scanning, banner grabbing, social engineering)
3. Attack (exploit, escalate, install tools)
4. Reporting (with mitigation recommendations!)

### **🔧 KEY DISTINCTIONS:**

**Vulnerability Scan vs Penetration Test:**


| Feature | Vuln Scan | Pentest |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Method | Automated | Manual |
| Goal | Find vulnerabilities | Exploit vulnerabilities |
| Frequency | Quarterly | Annually |
| Duration | Minutes | Days/weeks |

**Pentest Types:**

- **Black box** = no knowledge
- **White box** = full knowledge
- **Grey box** = partial knowledge
- **External** = outside perimeter
- **Internal** = inside perimeter
- **Covert** = teams not informed

**Risk Approaches:**

- **Ad hoc** = random, no strategy (BAD!)
- **Compliance-based** = checklist mentality
- **Risk-based** = identify specific risks (BEST!)
