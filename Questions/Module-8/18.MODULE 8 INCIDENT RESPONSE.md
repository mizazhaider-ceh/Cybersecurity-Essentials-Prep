- Full Backup: 1 backup
- Differential: 2 backups (1 Full + 1 Diff)
- Incremental: 6 backups (1 Full + 5 Incr)

**CRITICAL:**

- **Recovery should be tested regularly!**

**Why test recovery regularly?**

**Answer:** Ensure backups work and recovery procedures are effective

## 🎯 **KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 8**

### **⚡ CRITICAL CONCEPTS:**

**Event vs Incident:**

- **Event** = ANY observable occurrence (not necessarily bad)
- **Incident** = Security violation or threat requiring expertise
- Events → normal business; Incidents → security response

**Incident Classification:**

- **US-CERT:** By attack vector (Attrition, Web, Email, Media, Spoofing, Improper Usage, Loss/Theft)
- **ENISA:** By class (Abusive Content, Malicious Code, Information Gathering, Intrusions, Availability, etc.)

**Incident Response Phases (6):**

1. **Preparation** - Plan before incident
2. **Detection \& Analysis** - Identify incident
3. **Investigation** - Identify perpetrator (if needed)
4. **Containment** - Limit damage
5. **Eradication \& Recovery** - Remove threat, restore systems
6. **Post-incident Activity** - Lessons learned

**Evidence Handling:**

- **Chain of Custody** = Document all handling
- **Copy hard disk \& RAM FIRST** (before reboot!)
- Legal requirements vary by country
- International incidents = potential conflicts

**Digital Forensics (4 phases):**

1. **Identify** - Locate evidence
2. **Preserve** - Retrieve and protect (imaging!)
3. **Analyze** - Extract and interpret
4. **Present** - Report findings

**Anti-Forensics:**

- Data deletion (overwriting)
- Encryption
- Hiding data (slack space)
- **Steganography** (hiding in plain sight)

**BCP vs DR:**

- **BCP** = Keep business running (even without IT)
- **DR** = Restore IT infrastructure/data
- **BIA** = Identify critical operations, resources, threats

**Backup Methods:**


| Method | Definition | Recovery Speed | Storage Space | Backups to Restore (example) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Full** | All files | Fastest | Most | 1 |
| **Differential** | Changed since last FULL | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| **Incremental** | Changed since LAST (any) | Slowest | Least | 6+ |

**Backup Rules:**

- **3-2-1:** 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite
- **3-2-1-1-0:** + 1 offline, 0 errors (test regularly!)
- **Immutable backups** = ransomware-proof


### **📝 CRITICAL DEFINITIONS:**

**NIST Incident:**
"Violation or threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices"

**Chain of Custody:**
Documentation of how evidence is handled (ownership, transfer, alteration) to prove integrity

**Steganography:**
Hiding data in plain sight (e.g., message in image LSB, first letters of words)

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective):**
Maximum acceptable data loss (how much data can we afford to lose?)

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective):**
Maximum acceptable recovery time (how long can we be down?)

### **🔧 KEY TOOLS:**

**Windows:**

- **eventvwr** - Event Viewer (view system events)

**Forensics:**

- **Write-blockers** - Prevent modification during imaging
- **Wireshark** - Network traffic analysis
- **SIEM** - Log file analysis automation

**Backup:**

- Disk, tape, cloud
- Onsite + offsite
- Regular testing!


### **🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS:**

1. **Reboot = Lost Evidence!** Copy RAM first!
2. **Investigation vs IR Conflict:** Investigation needs time; IR needs speed
3. **International Legal Issues:** GDPR vs US law conflicts
4. **No Backup = No RPO!** Backups essential!
5. **Test Recovery Regularly!** Backups useless if can't restore!
6. **Every Disaster is Incident** (but not vice versa)
7. **Steganography is Invisible** - can hide malware in images!
