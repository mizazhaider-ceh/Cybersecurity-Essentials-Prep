Access control that grants permissions based on attributes like department, location, time of day is called _________ Access Control.

**Answer:** Attribute-Based (ABAC)

**Explanation:** **ABAC = Attribute-Based Access Control** - decisions based on **attributes** (user, resource, environment attributes).

***

**Question 156** (🟡 Medium)

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** differs from RBAC because:

A) They're the same

B) MAC uses security labels/classifications assigned by system; user cannot change

C) RBAC is stricter

D) MAC is only for roles

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **MAC** = access based on **security labels** (e.g., Top Secret, Secret, Confidential)
System-enforced, users **cannot change** their clearance level.
RBAC = based on job roles.

***

**Question 157** (🔴 Hard - MATCHING)

Match the access control type to its characteristic:

**Types:**
1. RBAC
2. ABAC
3. MAC
4. DAC

**Characteristics:**
A) Owner controls access
B) Based on job roles
C) Based on multiple attributes
D) Based on security labels

**Answer:** 1-B, 2-C, 3-D, 4-A

***

**Question 158** (🟡 Medium)

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** allows:

A) System to control everything

B) Resource owner to grant/revoke access at their discretion

C) No access control

D) Military-only access

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **DAC** = **owner** of resource decides who can access.
Example: File owner grants read access to colleagues.

***

**Question 159** (🟡 Medium - SCENARIO)

An employee should only access customer records for the region they manage. This combines:

A) Only Least Privilege

B) Need to Know + Least Privilege + ABAC (location attribute)

C) Full access

D) No controls

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ Multiple principles:
- **Need to Know** (only their customers)
- **Least Privilege** (only required access)
- **ABAC** (region attribute filters access)

***

**Question 160** (🔴 Hard)

What is the MAIN benefit of implementing multiple access control principles together?

A) Simpler management

B) Defense in depth for access - if one control fails, others still protect

C) Faster access

D) Less security

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **Defense in depth** for access control:
Multiple principles (Least Privilege + Need to Know + Four-Eyes) provide **layered protection**.
If one fails or is bypassed, others still limit damage.

B) Acceptable amount of data loss - time from last backup to incident

C) Number of backups needed

D) Cost of recovery

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO** = **acceptable data loss** - indicates most recent time from which acceptable to restore data (usually last backup).
**Maximum time** from last restore point to incident.

***

**Question 164** (🟡 Medium)

**RTO** is:

A) Acceptable data loss

B) Time needed for estimated return to reliable state ("business as usual")

C) Backup frequency

D) Cost of downtime

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RTO** = **time needed** for estimated return to **reliable state**.
Time from **incident** to estimated return to **"business as usual"**.

***

**Question 165** (🔴 Hard - CALCULATION)

A company makes backups every week. An incident occurs just before a new backup. What is the RPO?

A) 1 day

B) 1 week

C) 1 month

D) 1 hour

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO = 1 week**.
RPO is **exact calculable figure**. Backup every week → maximum time to go back = **1 week** (if incident just before new backup).

***

**Question 166** (🔴 Hard)

**True or False:**

"RPO is an exact calculable figure, while RTO is more of an objective based on experience."

**Answer:** True

**Explanation:**
**True**:

- **RPO** = **exact calculable** (based on backup frequency)
- **RTO** = **objective** based on experience, established in IR Policy

***

**Question 167** (🔴 Hard)

RTO should be determined by:

A) Making it as long as possible

B) Cost of being operational again must be strictly smaller than loss of not being operational

C) Random selection

D) Always 1 hour

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RTO determination**: **Cost of being operational** must be **strictly smaller** than **loss of not being operational**.
Usually should be **as short as possible**, balanced against cost.

***

**Question 168** (🟡 Medium)

**Fill in the blanks:**

_________ quantifies the allowable amount of data loss, while _________ quantifies the acceptable downtime.

**Answer:** RPO, RTO

**Explanation:**

- **RPO** = allowable **data loss**
- **RTO** = acceptable **downtime**

***

**Question 169** (🔴 Hard - SCENARIO)

Company A makes daily backups at midnight. A ransomware attack occurs at 11:00 PM (23 hours after last backup). What is the RPO?

A) 23 hours

B) 24 hours

C) 1 day

D) 1 week

**Answer:** B (or C - same thing)

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO = 24 hours (1 day)** - maximum time between backups.
Even though attack was 23 hours after backup, RPO is determined by backup **frequency** (daily = 24 hours max).

***

☐ D) Training and simulation requirements
☐ E) Communication guidelines

**Answer:** ALL (A, B, C, D, E)

**Explanation:**
✅ **IR Policy contents**:

- CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)
- Detection, prioritization, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery
- RPO and RTO

- Internal/external communication
- Reporting and escalation

***

**Question 171** (🟡 Medium)

**Fill in the blank:**

The incident response team is called _________.

**Answer:** CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)

**Explanation:** **CSIRT = Computer Security Incident Response Team**.

***

**Question 172** (🔴 Hard - CALCULATION)

A company backs up every 4 hours. An incident occurs 3 hours after the last backup. What data is potentially lost?

A) 3 hours of data

B) 4 hours of data (RPO)

C) 7 hours of data

D) No data

**Answer:** A (but B is RPO)

**Explanation:**
**Actual loss** = 3 hours (time since last backup)
**RPO** = 4 hours (maximum acceptable loss based on backup frequency)
RPO is the **maximum**; actual loss may be less.

***

**Question 173** (🟡 Medium)

What is the relationship between **backup frequency** and **RPO**?

A) No relationship

B) More frequent backups = lower RPO (less data loss)

C) More frequent backups = higher RPO

D) Backups don't affect RPO

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **More frequent backups** = **lower RPO** = **less potential data loss**.
Hourly backups = RPO of 1 hour
Daily backups = RPO of 24 hours

***

**Question 174** (🔴 Hard - SCENARIO)

A hospital's critical patient record system has RTO of 15 minutes and RPO of 5 minutes. This means:

A) Low priority system

B) Critical system requiring near-real-time backup and fast recovery

C) Normal office system

D) No backup needed

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **15-minute RTO** = must recover within 15 minutes
✅ **5-minute RPO** = can only lose 5 minutes of data
= **Critical system** requiring continuous/near-real-time backup and rapid recovery.

***

**Question 175** (🟡 Medium)

**Fill in the blank:**

The time from incident to when business returns to "normal" is called the _________.

**Answer:** RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

**Explanation:** **RTO** = time from incident to return to **"business as usual"**.

***

**Question 176** (🟡 Medium)

Which is typically LONGER - RPO or RTO?

A) Always RPO

B) Depends on the system - RPO and RTO are independent metrics

C) Always RTO

D) They're always equal

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO and RTO are independent** - determined by business needs.
Critical transaction system: Low RPO (minimal data loss)
Standard report system: Lower RTO priority
Each system assessed individually.

***

**Question 177** (🔴 Hard - SCENARIO)

An e-commerce company calculates: 1 hour downtime = €100,000 lost revenue. Recovery costs €50,000 and takes 2 hours. Is this RTO acceptable?

A) Yes, acceptable RTO

B) No - cost of downtime (€200,000) exceeds recovery cost (€50,000)

C) RTO doesn't matter

D) Not enough information

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ 2-hour downtime = €200,000 lost
Recovery cost = €50,000
**Cost of being operational (€50,000) < Loss of downtime (€200,000)**
This RTO is acceptable. Should invest in recovery.
