C) Number of backups needed

D) Cost of recovery

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO** = **acceptable data loss** - indicates most recent time from which acceptable to restore data (usually last backup).

A) 1 day

B) 1 week

C) 1 month

D) 1 hour

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RPO = 1 week**.
RPO is **exact calculable figure**. Backup every week → maximum time to go back = **1 week** (if incident just before new backup).

***

**Question 166** (🔴 Hard)

**True or False:**

"RPO is an exact calculable figure, while RTO is more of an objective based on experience."

**Answer:** True

**Explanation:**
**True**:

- **RPO** = **exact calculable** (based on backup frequency)
- **RTO** = **objective** based on experience, established in IR Policy

***

**Question 167** (🔴 Hard)

RTO should be determined by:

A) Making it as long as possible

B) Cost of being operational again must be strictly smaller than loss of not being operational

C) Random selection

D) Always 1 hour

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
✅ **RTO determination**: **Cost of being operational** must be **strictly smaller** than **loss of not being operational**.
Usually should be **as short as possible**, balanced against cost.

***

**Question 168** (🟡 Medium)

**Fill in the blanks:**

_________ quantifies the allowable amount of data loss, while _________ quantifies the acceptable downtime.
