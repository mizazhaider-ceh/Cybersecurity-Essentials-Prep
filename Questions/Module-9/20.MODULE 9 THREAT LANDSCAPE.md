| **3. Domain Names** | Easy | Easy (for attacker to change) |
| **4. Network/Host Artifacts** | Annoying | Annoying (for attacker to change) |
| **5. Tools** | Challenging | Challenging (for attacker to change) |
| **6. TTPs** | Tough! | **PAINFUL** for attacker to change! |

**Explanation:**

**Bottom (Easy to detect, easy for attacker to evade):**

- **IP addresses:** Get new IP easily
- **Domain names:** Register new domain

**Top (Hard to detect, PAINFUL for attacker to change):**

- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures):** Attacker's entire methodology

    - **Retraining** of personnel (if organized group)
    - **New development** of attack methods
    - Significant **time and resources**

**Example:**

- **Hash value:** Change one byte of malware → new hash (trivial)
- **TTP:** Change from phishing-based attacks to exploiting zero-days → requires completely different skillset, tools, and approach (PAINFUL!)

## 📝 **CRITICAL DEFINITIONS TO KNOW**

**Threat Landscape:**
"A comprehensive snapshot of the current cybersecurity threat environment that aggregates and synthesizes threat intelligence data from dozens of sources to present macro-level trends, emerging risks, and threat actor behaviors."

**APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):**
"A targeted threat composed of various complex attack vectors that can remain undetected for an extended period of time, characterized by thorough planning, sophistication, stealth, and persistence."

**Breach (VERIS):**
"An incident that results in the confirmed disclosure (not just potential disclosure) of data to an unauthorized party."

**IoC (Indicator of Compromise):**
"Anything that can be detected and that is or can be a sign that your system is compromised by an attack."

**TTP:**
"Tactics, Techniques \& Procedures - the attacker's methodology and approach, representing the top of the Pyramid of Pain (most painful to change)."

**Consumerization of IT:**
"Technology arises first in the consumer market and then spreads to business and government (opposite of historical pattern)."

**Big Data:**
"Huge amounts of rapidly varying data of wide variety, characterized by Volume, Velocity, and Variety (3 Vs)."

**Data Poisoning:**
"Feeding AI wrong or biased data on purpose to make it decide incorrectly, used to manipulate machine learning systems."

***

## 🔧 **KEY FRAMEWORKS \& TOOLS TO RECOGNIZE**

**VERIS:**

- Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing
- Used by Verizon DBIR
- Components: Asset, Actor, Action, Attribute

**MITRE ATT\&CK:**

- Adversarial Tactics, Techniques \& Common Knowledge
- Free, open knowledge base
- Covers Enterprise, Mobile, ICS
- Based on real-world observations

**Pyramid of Pain:**

- 6 levels: Hash Values → IP Addresses → Domain Names → Network/Host Artifacts → Tools → TTPs
- Higher = more painful for attacker

**APT Kill Chain:**

- 8 phases: Selection → Research → Penetration → C2 → Discovery → Exfiltration → Exploitation → Dissemination

***

## ⚠️ **COMMON EXAM TRAPS**

1. **Breach vs Incident:** Not all incidents are breaches! Breach requires CONFIRMED data disclosure.
2. **MDM vs MAM:**
    - MDM = Managed devices (company-owned)
    - MAM = BYOD/non-managed devices
3. **Phishing Trend:** In 2024 DBIR, phishing NOW dominates (57%) - was opposite last year (pretexting dominated).
4. **Pyramid of Pain:** TTPs are at TOP (most painful), not bottom!
5. **AI Types:** Deep Learning extracts features itself; Machine Learning needs humans to define features.
6. **Cloud Risk:** "The Cloud" doesn't exist - there are MULTIPLE clouds!
7. **Data Breach Cost:** For lost laptops, 80% of cost is DATA BREACH, not hardware replacement!
8. **BlueBorne:** Bluetooth vulnerability that works WITHOUT pairing!
9. **MOVEit Transfer:** SQL injection (not ransomware encryption) was the vulnerability!
10. **ENISA Focus:** EU-focused (not global like Verizon DBIR).
