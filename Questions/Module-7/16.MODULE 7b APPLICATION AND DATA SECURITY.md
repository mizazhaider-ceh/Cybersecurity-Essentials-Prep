## 🎯 **KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 7b**

### **⚡ CRITICAL CONCEPTS:**

**SDLC vs DevSecOps:**

- **SDLC:** Linear phases, security often afterthought
- **DevSecOps:** Continuous cycle, security integrated from start

**Security Testing Methods:**


| Method | Type | When | Example Tool |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| SAST | White-box | Source code analysis (not running) | SonarQube |
| DAST | Black-box | Running application testing | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite |
| IAST | Grey-box | Real-time monitoring | Various |

**OWASP Key Points:**

- Non-profit improving web app security
- Top 10 list updated every 4 years
- ZAP = test tool simulating attacks
- ASVS = security verification standard
- Juice Shop = intentionally insecure app for training

**Data Classification:**

- Keep categories minimal (Public, Confidential, Secret)
- Uses metadata tagging
- Defined in data classification policy

**Database Security:**

- **Typical issues:** SQL injection, unpatched software, weak authentication
- **Key controls:** Encryption, RBAC, MFA, audit logging, backups
- **Best practices:** Least privilege, segregation of duties, database firewalls

**Data Roles:**

- **Data Owner:** Business (NOT IT!), determines classification/security
- **Data Custodian:** Manages storage/security, not content
- **Data Stewards:** Concerned with meaning/use, not storage

**GDPR Essentials:**

- Effective: May 25, 2018
- Covers: Personal data (anything identifying natural person)
- Breach reporting: 72 hours to authority
- Key roles: Controller, Processor, DPO, Data Subject
- 7 principles: Lawfulness, Purpose Limitation, Data Minimization, Accuracy, Storage Limitation, Integrity/Confidentiality, Accountability


### **📝 MUST KNOW:**

**DevSecOps Phases:**

- **Dev:** Threat modelling, secure coding, SAST, DAST, IAST, pentesting
- **Ops:** Secure transfer, security config, security scan, security patch, security audit, security monitor (SIEM), security analysis

**OWASP Proactive Controls (Top 10):**

1. Access control (least privilege)
2. Cryptography
3. Input validation (prevent SQL injection)
4. Security from beginning
5. Secure default configurations
6. Keep components safe
7. Secure digital identities (MFA)
8. Browser security features
9. Security logging/monitoring
10. Stop SSRF

**GDPR Principles (7):**

1. Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency
2. Purpose Limitation
3. Data Minimization
4. Accuracy
5. Storage Limitation
6. Integrity and Confidentiality
7. Accountability

**Regulations by Data Type:**

- Personal data → GDPR (EU)
- Sensitive info → NIS2 (EU)
- Credit cards → PCI-DSS (Global)
- Medical → HIPAA (USA)
- Financial → SOX (USA)
