- Must work in **real-time** → often no 'overhead' software (e.g., security checks)
- **Nowadays:** More often networked
- Strong evolution towards network devices for better operational control/reporting
- **AIC instead of CIA** (Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality)
- **Long lifespan** compared to IT devices

**What priority model do industrial systems use?**

**Answer:** AIC (Availability first!) instead of CIA

**Question 213** (🔴 **CRITICAL - INDUSTRIAL IMPACT!**)

**Industrial Systems - Impact of Attack:**

Could be **SEVERE** (e.g., gas tank monitoring equipment):

- **Catastrophic failure** → business paralyzed
- Possibly **LIFE-THREATENING**

**Possible Mitigating Controls:**

- Firewall
- **Network segmentation** (minimally OT/IT separation; also isolate vulnerable systems like Windows XP)
- Authentication
- **Change default passwords**
- Encryption (where possible)
- Updates

**Why is industrial system security critical?**

**Answer:** Attacks can be life-threatening and cause catastrophic failures

## 🎯 **KEY EXAM TIPS FOR MODULE 7a**

### **⚡ MUST KNOW FOR EXAM:**

From exam review:

1. ✅ **Security Management is part of Network Management** (FCAPS)
2. ✅ **LAN definition and components** (Repeater, Hub, Bridge, Switch, Router)
3. ✅ **Wireless Introduction \& WLAN**
4. ✅ **WAN**
5. ✅ **Ports \& Protocols Review** (65,536 ports, tunneling)
6. ✅ **Starting a device (Booting)** - RECOGNIZE the process!
7. ✅ **What is an operating system?**
8. ✅ **Operating modes** (User Mode vs Kernel Mode)
9. ✅ **Platform hardening UNIX** (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, etc.)
10. ✅ **Registry important components** (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, etc.)
11. ✅ **Endpoint Security Solutions** (AV-Test source)

### **📝 CRITICAL CONCEPTS:**

**FCAPS Model:**

- **F**ault Management
- **C**onfiguration Management
- **A**ccounting Management
- **P**restation (Performance) Management
- **S**ecurity Management

**LAN Components by OSI Layer:**

- **Physical:** Repeater, Hub
- **Data Link:** Bridge, Layer-2 Switch
- **Network:** Router, Layer-3 Switch

**Wireless Security Evolution:**

- **WEP** → BROKEN (RC4, crackable in minutes)
- **WPA** → Better (one key per packet)
- **WPA2** → AES mandatory
- **WPA3** → Weak password protection

**Windows User Types:**

- **Normal User** → Limited access
- **Administrator** → System config access
- **System User** → Full access (everything)

**Virtualization:**

- **Host** = physical server (single point of failure!)
- **Guest** = virtual OS
- **Hypervisor** = management layer

**Industrial Systems:**

- **AIC** priority (not CIA!)
- Life-threatening impact possible
- Network segmentation critical


### **🔧 KEY SECURITY MEASURES:**

**LAN Security:**

- Change default passwords
- Use MAC address filtering
- Encrypt traffic (IPsec)
- Implement NAC

**Wireless Security:**

- Use WPA3 (minimum WPA2)
- Hide SSID
- Filter MAC addresses
- Use VPN for sensitive connections

**Platform Hardening:**

- Disable unnecessary ports/services/protocols
- Remove default users/passwords
- Harden based on Common Criteria (EAL levels)

**Remote Access:**

- Always use VPN
- Implement strong authentication
- Apply least privilege
- Secure home computers
