## **PART I: VIRTUALIZATION (Questions 191-210)**


***

**Question 191** (🟡 Medium - **DEFINITION!**)

**Virtualization:**

- Allows multiple OS's ("**guests**") to coexist on same physical server ("**host**")
- In **isolation** of one another
- Example: VMware

**Creates layer between hardware and guest OSs:**

- Manages shared processing and memory resources on host
- Often called **HYPERVISOR**

**What is the management layer called?**

**Answer:** Hypervisor

***

**Question 192** (🔴 **CRITICAL - SECURITY CONCERN!**)

**Virtualization - Key Security Concern:**

- Successful attack on host → compromise **LARGER in scope and impact**
- Affects ALL guests on that host

**Diagram:**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  VM 1 | VM 2 | ... | VM x│ ← All guests at risk
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Hypervisor on Host    │ ← Single point of failure!
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**True or False:** "Compromising the hypervisor affects all virtual machines."

**Answer:** True

***

**Question 193** (🔴 **CRITICAL - VIRTUALIZATION PROBLEMS!**)

**Virtualization - Potential Security Problems:**

1. **Inadequate host configuration** → vulnerabilities affecting host AND guests
2. **Exploits of host vulnerabilities** or **DoS attack** → affects ALL guests
3. **Compromise of management console** (hypervisor console) → unapproved admin access to all guests
4. **Insecure protocols for remote access** → exposure of administrative credentials

**Most critical:**

**Answer:** \#3 - Management console compromise = full control!

***

**Question 194** (🟡 Medium - **MITIGATING CONTROLS!**)
